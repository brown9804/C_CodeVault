----------

This repository is a collection of various algorithms implemented in the C programming language. These examples serve as a great starting point for those who want to learn more about coding in C and its applications.

## Contents

1. [Simulating Space Invaders](./SpaceInvaders/README.md): This program simulates the classic game of Space Invaders. It demonstrates how to handle user input, game physics, collision detection, and rendering in C.
2. [Examples of How C Works](./BeginnerExercises/README.md): This section contains various examples that demonstrate the working of C language. It covers topics like variables, data types, control structures, functions, pointers, and more.
3. [Drawing a Flower with Recursive Circles](./CircleFlowers/README.md): This program draws a flower with recursive circles. The number of circles is provided via the command line. It's a great example of recursion and graphics programming in C.
4. [Floodfill](./Floodfill/README.md): This program identifies if its surroundings are identical and if so, it replaces them in the same way to the starting position by command line.
5. [Christmas Tree](./ChristmasTree/README.md): This program draws a Christmas tree on the console. It's a fun example of how to use loops and string manipulation in C.
6. [Turtle Moves](./TurtlesMoves/README.md): This program simulates the movements of a turtle on a 2D grid. It's a great example of how to handle complex data structures and algorithms in C.
7. [Mouse Labyrinth](./MouseLabyrinth/README.md): This program draws a maze and solves it via command line.
